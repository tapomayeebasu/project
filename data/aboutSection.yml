  ### I collet, analyse and interpret data.
  
  I love stuying complex data. I collect the data to develop hypothesis,
  make inferences and analyse customer and market trends. It includes 
  gathering and analysing the data using various types of analysing 
  and reporting tools to detect pattern, trends and relationships in
  data sets. I also try my best to create complex predictive model to
